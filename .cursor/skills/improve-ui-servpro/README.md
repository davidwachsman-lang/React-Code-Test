# improve-ui-servpro

Project-level skill for migrating **one page at a time** to the ServPro Precision theme (light + dark).

## How to use

In chat, ask to improve a single page, for example:

- *"Use improve-ui-servpro to improve the Job Files page"*
- *"Improve the UI of the Forms page"*
- *"Migrate the Daily War Room page to Precision theme"*

The agent will follow [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md): apply Precision layout and tokens, refactor the page CSS (and any page-specific component CSS), enforce standard input design from THEME_PROGRESS.md, then update THEME_PROGRESS.md.

**Improved so far:** Intake, Dispatch, WIP Board, Estimating, CRM, Field Services, Goals, Reporting & Analytics, Financials & Billing, Storm.

**Not yet improved:** Job Files, Forms, TM Estimate, Daily War Room, Expectations 2026, Sandbox, Insurance Job SOPs, Conversion (see THEME_PROGRESS.md).
